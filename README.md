# Gift Exchange 2.0 Outline

## **What used to happen?**

The extended family would get together each Christmas and exchange presents with each other. Every grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, cousin, etc. Received a gift from every family. This distributed system was not financially sustainable, especially with younger adults becoming more independent and willing to purchase gifts. This tradition soon lead to burnout due to precise coordination amongst significant others in each family in order to acquire a gift that the individual would enjoy.

After all was said and done, the amount of money spent in totality was extreme, and some argued, a bit much for a family that is very fortunate to have all they need on a day-to-day basis. Wealth was being redistributed amongst each family, and not in the most meaningful, giving-inspired way. Though wealth redistribution is inevitable in the holidays, we could reduce the volume of this redistribution and hopefully make the holidays less about gift buying and receiving, and more about our sheer presence.

This opened an opportunity for improvement. Then came the **Secret Santa Exchange**.

## **The Secret Santa Exchange: A better, yet suboptimal, solution**

The way to solve the problem of spending less money as a group was to very simply just have each individual spend money on one individual. Nobody would be receiving gifts from more than one person (minus grandparents for tradition's sake). Each family member was to create a wish list of items they would like to receive from their secret Santa, who was to be randomly assigned leading up to the gift exchange on Christmas. It was the duty of the secret Santa to look at their assigned individual's wish list and purchase one of those items for them to bring to them during the gift exchange.

While this clearly does reduce the amount of money spent in total, it completely removes the surprise element of Christmas, and results in each person thinking about just one family member during the Christmas season. If we are to give, we should have the giving spirit be spread amongst each family member.

So, how do we bring back the true spirit of Christmas while also reducing our spending? The North Pole Voting Polls.

## **A proposed solution: The North Poll**

The idea is simple. We continue to limit one individual to receiving a single gift, but instead of having an assigned secret Santa, the collective whole agrees upon on a gift for that individual through a polling mechanism of suggested gift ideas. The family will suggest gift ideas on that individual's polling board, and other family members will agree (upvote) on the suggestion, or write their own. The individual being polled is not to write down anything they are hoping to receive, as this discourages genuine ideas for those polling this person for gift ideas. While this may seem like a hindrance if no ideas are sparking, it really encourages the family to _think_ about the other person as opposed to reading a list and buying the first thing on it. Giving is supposed to be meaningful and also be a surprise!

This process is repeated for each individual so that every family member has thought of each individual and had a say in what that person receives (whether that is adding an item they believe they would like, or simply just voting on an item somebody else has suggested). It's a blend of the entire family gift exchange and the secret Santa. It solves both problems and has opportunity to be more fun with a few twists we will outline below.

### Guardrails to the North Poll

Coming up with gift ideas can be stressful and sometimes overwhelming. That's why this application has configuration options to add some assistance.

- Configuration option #1: Spending limit
  - With a spending limit, it might be easier to think of something that the individual may like/want.
- Configuration option #2: Exchange theme
  - This could be something such as home improvement, fitness, entertainment, food, etc. Regardless of the category, it may stir some creativity amongst those coming up with gift ideas for members in their group. It narrows the scope down in a world where there are already too many options.
